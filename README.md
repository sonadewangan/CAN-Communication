# CAN-Communication
This project demonstrates the simulation of Controller Area Network (CAN) communication using the python-can library in a fully virtual environment on Windows. It includes the transmission and reception of CAN messages and simulates various error frames (bit error, stuff error, and CRC error) without requiring physical hardware.
